  Commands:

    start     - Starts the application
                (optional, this is the default if the app IS NOT running) 

    stop      - Stops a running application
                (Safely stopping the application workers)

    restart   - Restarts a running application
                (Safely stopping the application workers)

    terminate - Terminates a running application
                (KILLS the processes ASAP)

    status    - Reports on the status of the running application
                (optional, this is the default if the app IS running)



Running 'firestarter' with no options will report on the current status of the service, or (if there is a 'appMain' entry in the config file, and the app is not currenly running), it starts the app.

You can use the Options on the command line, but it is often better to use a firestarter.config file in your projects home directory.  The format of this file is a JSON file, with each of the long option names, as a field name, e.g.:

    {             
        "workers": 8,
        "ipc": "/var/run/myapp.ipc",
        "log_dir": "/var/log/myapp",
        "github_auto_deploy": true
    }

Alternately, you can put a section in your package.json file that uses the same structure, e.g.:

    "firestarter": {             
        "workers": 8,
        "ipc": "/var/run/myapp.ipc",
        "log_dir": "/var/log/myapp",
        "github_auto_deploy": true
    }

If command line options are specified, and there is a conflicting entry in the config file, the command line options will be accepted as the users desired intention.
